  # whenever you save to the database, send an email to the Author alerting them the post was saved

# to make sure all of our Posts have the correctly formatted title, we are going to run make_title_case during the first of the available lifecycle points

#We'd expect that whenever Rails persists Post models to the database, (so #save and #create) this code will get run.
#bundle exec rails c (console):
# p = Post.create(title: "testing")
# p.valid? => false, it wasn't saved to the database
